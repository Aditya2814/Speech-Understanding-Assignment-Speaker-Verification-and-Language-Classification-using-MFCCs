## Overview

This Project is divided into two main tasks:

### üß† Task 1: Speaker Verification and Identification
- Evaluated speaker verification performance using Microsoft's pre-trained **UniSpeechSatForXVector** model.
- Fine-tuned the model on VoxCeleb2 using:
  - **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** via PEFT
  - **ArcFace Loss** for better embedding separation
- Evaluated on **VoxCeleb1 (cleaned)** dataset.
- Key metrics:
  - Equal Error Rate (EER)
  - TAR@1%FAR
  - Speaker Identification Accuracy

üìà **Results after fine-tuning:**
- EER reduced from **42.30% ‚Üí 9.50%**
- TAR@1%FAR improved to **~65.40%**
- Identification Accuracy improved to **~84.68%**

### üó£Ô∏è Task 2: Language Identification using MFCC
- Extracted **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)** features from audio samples in 10 Indian languages.
- Visualized MFCC spectrograms for Gujarati, Bengali, and Tamil.
- Performed statistical analysis on mean and variance of MFCCs.
- Built a **Random Forest classifier** for language identification.

üìä **Classifier Accuracy:** ~61%  
üìå Kannada and Marathi achieved the highest performance.
